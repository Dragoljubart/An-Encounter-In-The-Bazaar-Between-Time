# An-Encounter-In-The-Bazaar-Between-Time
“The annulus object sings inside your grasp, its solresol-hymn pulling your body toward the altar. A Proteus form awaits—compact and round—sculpted from frozen blue rock, seated in patient stillness.
You comprehend its rachamim without understanding. The call has no sound, yet it crushes your mind with pressure. You place the annulus object as tribute.
Blue radiance tears the breathable space. A yawning passage opens, revealing a wound in the world: a narrow crevice between air and between time, where the rules of ‘before’ and ‘after’ spill out and fail to reassemble.”
